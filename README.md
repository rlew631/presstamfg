Run `yarn build` and `firebase deploy` to deploy the app to: presstamfg.web.app

ToDo:

- make cards for manufacturing page have the title text all at the same level, center the images and figure out buttons after that
- Set up pages for "Our Shop", "Capabilities" and "Contact"
- Get pics from current site
- Fill out using the copy from src/copy.json
- Make a separate page for engineering capabilities and manufacturing capabilities
- put in something for certifications
- under engineering add a "design for assembly" category
- Make all the pages have the same layout!!!
  - manufacturing should have the current materials/finishes put under a "CNC" category and add similar categories for the other processes
- Maybe instead of having a seperate "Design" page break the flow up so it's more of the first half of egineering: i.e. inspiration --> ideation --> implementation, repeat. Ideation and refinement would both fall under engineering. inspiration works well but it's hard to make into distinct categories
- maybe find some way to convey that keeping the production in-house leads to discovering/improving problems early on and the difference between product modifications and complete reworks (both able to happen more effectively in-house)
- what would the user story be for someone coming in at any point of the cycle and what does our "consulting service" hourly/weekly/etc. get billed out as.

-maybe for manufacturing services you can hover over any of the "machining", "3d printing" etc. cards and it grows. Also when you click it materials and whatever shows up under it where it's all bubbled together with the card as a tab
